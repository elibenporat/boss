## Motivation

Building a baseball data engine in Rust will enable everyday fans to perform data-intensive workloads, as well as efficient data gathering. Ambitiously, aiming for a baseball data platform that will rival what MLB clubs have internally, from an analytics perspective. Clearly, MLB clubs will have access to more, and likely better, data, however, by leveraging Rust we should be able to build the most performant baseball data engine in the world.
